# EchoNote

This is just a practice app.  
Built it to understand and try out basic Android components like:

- Activities
- Intents (explicit & implicit)
- Navigation between screens
- Passing data between activities

Nothing fancy. Just learning the core stuff step by step using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

### Why I Made This

To get hands-on with real app flow â€” screen to screen, sending data, opening links, and how things actually connect inside an Android app.

---

### Tech Used

- Kotlin  
- Jetpack Compose  
- Android Studio

---

### Note

This is a raw learning project â€” just to try things out and get more comfortable with the Android basics.
